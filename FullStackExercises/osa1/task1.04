/*1.4: course information step4
Next, we put the objects in the table, i.e. change the variable definitions of App to the following form and change all parts of the application accordingly:
*/
const App = () => {
  const course = 'Half Stack application development'
  const parts = [
    {
      name: 'Fundamentals of React',
      exercises: 10
    },
    {
      name: 'Using props to pass data',
      exercises: 7
    },
    {
      name: 'State of a component',
      exercises: 14
    }
  ]

  return (
    <div>
      ...
    </div>
  )
}
/*copy
NOTE: at this stage you can assume that the table always has three elements , i.e. it is not necessary to go through the table with a loop. We will come back to the rendering of components based on the objects in the table later in the next part of the course .

However, do not pass the different objects from the component App to the components Content and Total contained in it as separate props, but directly as a table:
*/
const App = () => {
  // const-määrittelyt

  return (
    <div>
      <Header course={...} />
      <Content parts={parts} />
      <Total parts={parts} />
    </div>
  )
}
